Tello Android Application and BT Gamepad Controller Interface

Created an Android Application that will control the Tello Drone with a BT Gamepad 
(I was using a Nvidia Shield Gamepad bound to my older Nexus 6 running Android 7.1.1)

Using Gstreamer to get the video stream back to the phone with low latency.

Currently tested and validated on

Pixel 		Android 9
Nexus 5x 	Android 8
Nexus 6		Android 7


Failing on 
Pixel 3		Android 10
Pixel 2		Android 10

I believe the failures are to do with the Android 10 operating system, need to investigate.
